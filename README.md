# WEB102 Prework - Sea Monster Crowdfunding

Submitted by: Jay Trivedi

Sea Monster Crowdfunding is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: 7 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded. DONE
- [ ] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games. DONE
- [ ] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding DONE
- [ ] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games. DONE (Bonus Feature I added was an extra button/event listener)

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
      If I had more time, I would have extra subpages such as an About US page, as well as a page for donating, if donors want to donate.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Some of the instructions were often times confusing, and I felt confused on what exactly was being asked. I also have not used Javascript in a while, so I found myself using the resources provided by Codepath, but overall, once I used these resources, the rest flowed smoothly.
